This is the source code for my thesis project! It contains a prototype for a dungeon crawling roguelike, and the writeup was focused primary on the architecture, which can support all kinds of novel roguelike gameplay mechanics.

This project was created using the Godot engine over the course of 5 months and countless hours of work. Throughout these hours, I learned the basic principles of game development and Godot, as well as a many project management skills. The writeup spanned over 60 pages and detailed the R&D process for general entity architecture, level generation, shader effects and many other systems.
